					<p>Kim is on most insurance plans as a provider, or is enrolled in most Employee Assistance plans in this area. Often you are able to use your insurance for psychotherapy, to assist in offsetting cost. Initial authorizations are often required and you start this with a call to your carrier. This information can be found on your insurance card or through your human resources department. He will accept your co-pay at each session and will bill your carrier though our billing staff. They make every attempt to collect the balance due and do a great job keeping up with all the insurance requirements. But keep in mind all charges are ultimately your responsibility.</p>
