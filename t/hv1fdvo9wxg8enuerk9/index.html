						<h1>Guided Meditation Imagery</h1>
						<p>Below are example exercises that I sometimes use in sessions to help clarify and focus the mind. The audio below can be used by anyone, but in session these exercises are often custom-tailored to you as an individual. This is a tool to assist in ones awareness, insight and find peace and serenity. The offerings here are based in Buddhist Vipassana meditation. Other words to describe these are: Creative visualization, learning mindfulness, prayer and hypnosis.</p>

								<h3>Eating Mindfully</h3>
								<p class="meditation_description">This meditation is a fun yet dramatic way to understand that “mindfulness” is not hard. You will need a few raisons for the best results! On the serious side, this exercise can be very helpful to those who struggle with food, food addictions and weight. It also illustrates that meditation does not take years of practice, or to be a Zen Master to create a benefit. Try it.</p>
