						<h1>Guided Meditation Imagery</h1>
						<p>Below are example exercises that I sometimes use in sessions to help clarify and focus the mind. The audio below can be used by anyone, but in session these exercises are often custom-tailored to you as an individual. This is a tool to assist in ones awareness, insight and find peace and serenity. The offerings here are based in Buddhist Vipassana meditation. Other words to describe these are: Creative visualization, learning mindfulness, prayer and hypnosis.</p>
