								<h2 class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">Individual Psychotherapy</h2>
								<p class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">Often one seeks individual treatment with concerns about their  world. Often issues with relationships, work or other life circumstances  may have its origins in childhood experiences, abuse or trauma and are impacting current adjustments. This focus on a look back lends insight into patterns of behavior that can be changed. To help the individual the therapist may take an eclectic approach drawing from many different philosophies of treatment.</p>
								<div class="wedge-2x"></div>
								<h2 class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">Family Therapy</h2>
								<p class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">Family based treatment is very helpful when small children or teens and their parents are the focus of concern. By bringing together the entire family everyone can help bring change and no one feels fully the brunt of the problem. It provides the therapist with the awareness of everyone and the input from everyone. Often the interaction is lively and dynamic, with change that can occur powerfully and quickly. Everyone can get better together.</p>
								<div class="wedge-2x"></div>
								<h2 class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</h2>
								<p class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">This is a broad term for a body of therapy that emphasizes the role of thinking, feeling, and behavior. Its theory is our thoughts cause our feelings and the way we behave. Change our thoughts and feelings and we will change our behavior. The therapist is interested in the here and now; what is happening in your life and how one can “get better rather than just feel better.” That change can be measured by specific behavioral change, day to day.
		
		It is a collaborative relationship between the therapist and the client. The therapy is structured by specific concrete goals that can be measured and the therapist uses specific techniques supported by research.</p>
								<div class="wedge-2x"></div>
								<h2 class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">ACT: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</h2>
								<p class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">ACT is a framework of therapy that asks you to accept the difficulties that come in life. A present orientation, or mindfulness that assist one in overcoming negative thoughts and feelings. That&#x27;s the acceptance. The ability to look at behaviors and character traits that are creating a poor choice or avoiding change, with the commitment to making  these changes. This framework is helpful in managing anxiety and depression. For example obsessing, worrying and playing things over and over keeps you stuck. Realizing that one can be in control of how you react, think and feel can assist in the commitment to do things differently.  The goal is to observe feelings, noticing the way you talk to yourself, your negative self- talk and counter these with more realistic measures. Come learn how to take action!</p>
								<div class="wedge-2x"></div>
								<h2 class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing</h2>
								<p class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">EMDR is a form of psychotherapy that was developed to assist with post-traumatic stress, but has implications in anxiety more broadly. It is seen to shift negative thoughts and feelings that have been stuck or unprocessed in the brain. Through bilateral stimulation of the brain during reactivation these memories are processed and become less troublesome. A specific protocol and training is administered during  a series of sessions to help work through the traumas or distressing events while in a safe and supportive environment. Simply put, it is a process that enables people to heal from emotional distress that are the result of disturbing life experiences.</p>
								<div class="wedge-2x"></div>
								<h2 class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">Self Psychology</h2>
								<p class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">It is theoretical school from psychoanalytic psychology that is the basis of most contemporary psychoanalyzes. It recognizes the critical role of empathy in explaining human development and developmental change. It is the belief in the fundamental need for caring for another as a need for healthy human development. Nourishing the self develops self esteem and ambition to assist the full realization of a person’s skills and talents. The theory is that children require confirmation and approving responses from their parents to develop emotionally and psychologically. This is the basis of assessing the need for treatment, assessing dysfunction and developmental issues that begin a creation of a goal for treatment.</p>
								<div class="wedge-2x"></div>
								<h2 class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">Hypnosis/Guided Imagery</h2>
								<p class="lax" data-lax-preset="fadeIn">The father of hypnotherapy is Milton Erickson. He has influenced the field of psychotherapy as he developed clinical hypnosis and the theory of its therapeutic use.
		
		We all go into trance states naturally when we day dream, create a deep focus of attention, or go to sleep and dream. Hypnosis is not mind control or brainwashing; the therapist with your assistance utilizes a patter of communication to influence and suggest change in ones feelings, memories, images, or to your internal dialogue.
		
		The Mayo Clinic defines hypnosis: “A trance like state in which you have heightened focus, concentration and inner absorption. Under hypnosis, you usually feel calm and relaxed, you can concentrate intensely on a specific thought, memory, feeling or sensation while blocking out distraction. Under hypnosis you’re more open then usual to suggestions, and this can modify your perceptions, behavior, sensations and emotions.”</p>
