					<h2>Individual Psychotherapy</h2>
					<p>Often one seeks individual treatment with concerns about their  world. Often issues with relationships, work or other life circumstances  may have its origins in childhood experiences, abuse or trauma and are impacting current adjustments. This focus on a look back lends insight into patterns of behavior that can be changed. To help the individual the therapist may take an eclectic approach drawing from many different philosophies of treatment.</p>

					<h2>Family Therapy</h2>
					<p>Family based treatment is very helpful when small children or teens and their parents are the focus of concern. By bringing together the entire family everyone can help bring change and no one feels fully the brunt of the problem. It provides the therapist with the awareness of everyone and the input from everyone. Often the interaction is lively and dynamic, with change that can occur powerfully and quickly. Everyone can get better together.</p>

					<h2>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</h2>
					<p>This is a broad term for a body of therapy that emphasizes the role of thinking, feeling, and behavior. Its theory is our thoughts cause our feelings and the way we behave. Change our thoughts and feelings and we will change our behavior. The therapist is interested in the here and now; what is happening in your life and how one can “get better rather than just feel better.” That change can be measured by specific behavioral change, day to day.
		
		It is a collaborative relationship between the therapist and the client. The therapy is structured by specific concrete goals that can be measured and the therapist uses specific techniques supported by research.</p>

					<h2>Self Psychology</h2>
					<p>It is theoretical school from psychoanalytic psychology that is the basis of most contemporary psychoanalyzes. It recognizes the critical role of empathy in explaining human development and developmental change. It is the belief in the fundamental need for caring for another as a need for healthy human development. Nourishing the self develops self esteem and ambition to assist the full realization of a person’s skills and talents. The theory is that children require confirmation and approving responses from their parents to develop emotionally and psychologically. This is the basis of assessing the need for treatment, assessing dysfunction and developmental issues that begin a creation of a goal for treatment.</p>

					<h2>Hypnosis/Guided Imagery</h2>
					<p>The father of hypnotherapy is Milton Erickson. He has influenced the field of psychotherapy as he developed clinical hypnosis and the theory of its therapeutic use.
		
		We all go into trance states naturally when we day dream, create a deep focus of attention, or go to sleep and dream. Hypnosis is not mind control or brainwashing; the therapist with your assistance utilizes a patter of communication to influence and suggest change in ones feelings, memories, images, or to your internal dialogue.
		
		The Mayo Clinic defines hypnosis: “A trance like state in which you have heightened focus, concentration and inner absorption. Under hypnosis, you usually feel calm and relaxed, you can concentrate intensely on a specific thought, memory, feeling or sensation while blocking out distraction. Under hypnosis you’re more open then usual to suggestions, and this can modify your perceptions, behavior, sensations and emotions.”</p>
